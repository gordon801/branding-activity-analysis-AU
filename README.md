# Branding Activity Analysis
This project was done to analyse the impact of an increased level of branding activity conducted in Australia and to assess if it produced a noticeable increase in the number of transactions. This assessment was done by comparing the results of an exposed area to increased digital advertisements (Western Australia) against the results from an non-exposed area (South Australia) where there was no change in advertising.

## Input
* branding_experiment_data.csv: Time-stamped data containing relevant statistics from across Australia (all states). 

## Analysis
* branding_analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook provides detailed analysis and documentation of the process.

## Results
The digital video campaign was successful in delivering an increase in the number of transactions in the exposed area relative to the non-exposed area, but this increase might not be as significant as expected. However, this also accompanied a significant increase in the number of users and new users, which should be factored into consideration as well. An increase in userbase might also be another important factor for assessing impact of branding activity in the future.
